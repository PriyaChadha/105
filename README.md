1. File named Std_deviation.py is the main file to calculate standard deviation

--> Formulae is: sqrt( sumOf( square(x-meanOfX) ) / n-1))

Steps:
--> read the x data values
--> calculate mean of those values
--> do square of the answer using ** operator
--> divide it by n-1, where n is the total length of the data elements
--> do square root of the previous answer.
--> Hurray!! you have caluted the variation between the data. ( Standard Deviation)


2. File named class1.py and class2.py are just as a practice of plotting data on the graph.
