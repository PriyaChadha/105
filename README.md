1. File named Std_deviation.py is the main file to calculate standard deviation

--> Formulae is: sqrt( sumOf( square(x-meanOfX) ) / n-1))

Steps:
1. --> read the x data values
2. --> calculate mean of those values
3. --> do square of the answer using ** operator
4. --> divide it by n-1, where n is the total length of the data elements
5. --> do square root of the previous answer.
6. --> Hurray!! you have caluted the variation between the data. ( Standard Deviation)


-->File named class1.py and class2.py are just as a practice of plotting data on the graph.
